This is just an overview of how we are going to use Github in the event one 
doesn't know or forgets.

We will be using Github's branching system, pull request system, comments and
issue sections.

There is one main branch, "master". This branch is not to be edited directly, 
the reason for this branch is to always have a place that is error free and 
can give the ability to start over if you break your branch. 

When starting a new task make a new branch, branching off of master. Make 
commits to the new branch and when everything is ready for review push the new
branch up Github.  From there go onto Github and select your newly pushed 
branch and make a pull request. From there other members from the group can 
review your code and make comments or concerns. Depending on if that person 
thinks it works well they can merge your branch to master. Please don't merge
your own branch.

Lets try one branch per 'issue' and name the branch something relevant to what
you are doing (for tracking purposes).
